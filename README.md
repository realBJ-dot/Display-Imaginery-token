# Display-Imaginery-token
This is an experimental web for displaying fake tokens (poker i used here).
Instructions:
You can just compile it with a live server (i.e. chrome) since there is only one html file that browser can compile. 

There is a left side bar displaying all the functionality of this web: sorting tokens by prices and time created, and filtering the prices and time created by user input. 

Please click the clear button after trying out each functionality.
The UI is simply straightforward, and the data stored in json is not huge but large enough for testing.
